Amplifier current measurement:

Take multiple samples during longer period and storing the info in DMA.
Trigger ADC channels via PTG, multiple channels simultaneously

Amplifier back EMF measurement:

By SW (determine when train is running at speed x) trigger PTG to read 
ADC channel(s) and sample 1 to x periods of PWM cycles the back EMF.
SW has to take care of disabling H-bridge into disconnected mode Brake = H, PWM = L.
